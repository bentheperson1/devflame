                In this lesson we will be setting up the development environment to allow for JavaScript development.

                            First, we are going to need a local server to serve us javascript content.<br> I personally use <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html">XAMPP</a>, So that is what we are going to be using in this course.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Second, we are going to need some kind of text/code editor.<br> We are going to be using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> for this course because it is not just limited to JavaScript. 
                            It has support for pretty much all languages.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            There are tutorials on how to setup both of these pieces of software on their respective websites so we will not be covering it here.
